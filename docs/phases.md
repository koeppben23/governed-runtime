# Phases

FlowGuard uses 14 explicit workflow phases across 3 independent flows. Every session starts at the **READY** phase after `/hydrate`.

## Flows

### Ticket Flow (Full Development Lifecycle)

```
READY → TICKET → PLAN → PLAN_REVIEW → VALIDATION → IMPLEMENTATION → IMPL_REVIEW → EVIDENCE_REVIEW → COMPLETE
```

### Architecture Flow (ADR Creation)

```
READY → ARCHITECTURE → ARCH_REVIEW → ARCH_COMPLETE
```

### Review Flow (Compliance Report)

```
READY → REVIEW → REVIEW_COMPLETE
```

## Phase Reference

### Shared Entry Point

| Phase | Description | Gate Type |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| READY | Post-hydrate entry point, choose a flow | Command-driven |

### Ticket Flow

| Phase | Description | Gate Type |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| TICKET | Record task description | Automatic |
| PLAN | Generate plan + self-review | Automatic (self-review) |
| PLAN_REVIEW | Human approves plan | **User Gate** |
| VALIDATION | Run validation checks | Automatic |
| IMPLEMENTATION | Execute plan | Automatic |
| IMPL_REVIEW | LLM reviews implementation | Automatic (self-review) |
| EVIDENCE_REVIEW | Human reviews evidence | **User Gate** |
| COMPLETE | Session complete | Terminal |

### Architecture Flow

| Phase | Description | Gate Type |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| ARCHITECTURE | Create ADR + self-review | Automatic (self-review) |
| ARCH_REVIEW | Human reviews ADR | **User Gate** |
| ARCH_COMPLETE | ADR accepted | Terminal |

### Review Flow

| Phase | Description | Gate Type |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| REVIEW | Generate compliance report | Automatic |
| REVIEW_COMPLETE | Report delivered | Terminal |

## Gate Types

### Command-Driven (READY)
- User selects a flow via command (`/ticket`, `/architecture`, `/review`)
- No guards — evaluator returns `pending` until a command is issued

### Automatic Gates
- No human intervention required
- Machine evaluates state and advances
- Examples: TICKET → PLAN, VALIDATION → IMPLEMENTATION

### Self-Review Gates
- LLM reviews its own output iteratively
- Convergence via digest-stop (output unchanged) or max iterations from policy
- Examples: PLAN, IMPL_REVIEW, ARCHITECTURE

### User Gates
- Require explicit human approval via `/review-decision`
- Four-eyes principle in regulated mode (reviewer must differ from session initiator)
- Examples: PLAN_REVIEW, EVIDENCE_REVIEW, ARCH_REVIEW

## Phase Details

### READY

**Entry:** `/hydrate`
**Exit:** `/ticket`, `/architecture`, or `/review`

Post-hydrate entry point. The system provides guidance on available flows. User selects a flow by issuing the corresponding command.

### TICKET

**Entry:** `/ticket` from READY
**Exit:** Automatic (advances to PLAN when ticket evidence is recorded)

Records the task description. Validates that the task is clear and actionable.

### PLAN

**Entry:** From TICKET
**Exit:** Automatic (self-review convergence advances to PLAN_REVIEW)

Generates an implementation plan with built-in self-review. The AI critically reviews its own plan and refines it until convergence.

### PLAN_REVIEW

**Entry:** Automatic from PLAN (self-review converged)
**Exit:** `/review-decision`

Human reviews and approves the plan before implementation begins. In regulated mode, a second person must review.

- `approve` → VALIDATION
- `changes_requested` → back to PLAN
- `reject` → back to TICKET

### VALIDATION

**Entry:** `/review-decision approve` from PLAN_REVIEW
**Exit:** Automatic (all checks passed → IMPLEMENTATION, any check failed → back to PLAN)

Runs automated validation checks defined by the active profile. All checks must pass to proceed.
Use `/validate` to run the checks.

### IMPLEMENTATION

**Entry:** Automatic from VALIDATION (all checks passed)
**Exit:** Automatic (auto-advances to IMPL_REVIEW)

AI implements the plan using OpenCode tools. Changed files are automatically tracked via git.
Use `/implement` to record evidence and auto-advance.

### IMPL_REVIEW

**Entry:** Automatic from IMPLEMENTATION (after `/implement`)
**Exit:** Automatic (review convergence)

LLM reviews the implementation against the plan. This is a self-review loop (similar to PLAN phase),
not a human gate. The LLM calls `flowguard_implement` with a `reviewVerdict` to record each iteration.
On convergence, auto-advances to EVIDENCE_REVIEW.

### EVIDENCE_REVIEW

**Entry:** Automatic from IMPL_REVIEW (review converged)
**Exit:** `/review-decision`

Final human review of all evidence before completion.

- `approve` → COMPLETE
- `changes_requested` → back to IMPLEMENTATION
- `reject` → back to TICKET

### COMPLETE

**Entry:** Automatic after EVIDENCE_REVIEW approval
**Exit:** Terminal

Ticket flow complete. Can be archived with `/archive`.

### ARCHITECTURE

**Entry:** `/architecture` from READY (or re-entry after `changes_requested` at ARCH_REVIEW)
**Exit:** Automatic (self-review convergence advances to ARCH_REVIEW)

Creates an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) in MADR format. The ADR must include `## Context`, `## Decision`, and `## Consequences` sections. Self-review loop refines the ADR until convergence.

### ARCH_REVIEW

**Entry:** Automatic from ARCHITECTURE (self-review converged)
**Exit:** `/review-decision`

Human reviews the ADR.

- `approve` → ARCH_COMPLETE (ADR status set to "accepted")
- `changes_requested` → back to ARCHITECTURE
- `reject` → back to READY

### ARCH_COMPLETE

**Entry:** Automatic after ARCH_REVIEW approval
**Exit:** Terminal

Architecture flow complete. ADR is accepted. MADR artifact is written. Can be archived with `/archive`.

### REVIEW

**Entry:** `/review` from READY
**Exit:** Automatic (report generation advances to REVIEW_COMPLETE)

Generates a compliance review report with evidence completeness matrix, four-eyes status, validation summary, and findings.

### REVIEW_COMPLETE

**Entry:** Automatic from REVIEW (report generated)
**Exit:** Terminal

Review flow complete. Report delivered. Can be archived with `/archive`.
